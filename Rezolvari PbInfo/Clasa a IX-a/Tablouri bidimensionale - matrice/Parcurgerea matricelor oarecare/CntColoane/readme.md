The problem is checking if a matrix has on columns the same elements and in case it does, it just doesnt count the column and it counts only the columns with each two elements different one from each other. I have used a frequency 1D array to detect if in a column there are 2 elements of the same value and in that case I simply not count that column.
The program returns how many columns are with all elements different from each other.
